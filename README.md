hmailserver-logviewer
=====================

A realtime hMailServer log viewer which works in your browser.

Save the HTML file on your computer and launch it with your HTML5 capable browser. 
HTML5 File API support is required to run. Every recent browser has that support. For detailed information, see http://caniuse.com/#feat=fileapi

Your log file will be parsed each half seconds at its default.
For now its only "feature" is thread grouping, so you will see your SMTP logs neatly.

Feel free to enhance or use it for your forking pleasure.
